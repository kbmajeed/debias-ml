# DebiasML

This code uses [Streamlit](streamlit.io) to review results and produce a report (similar to how you might use jupyter notebook but all the commands can be called from python files). Setting up the environment will install streamlit. You can call
```shell
$ streamlit help
```
from the command line for a short tutorial on using it.

The central code is written in adult_uci.py. Run the command:
```shell
$ python source/adult_uci.py
```
from the source directory to run it. The Streamlit report will open in your browser.
